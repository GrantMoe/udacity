x : estimate
P : uncertainty covariance
F : state transition matrix
u : motion vector
Z : measurement
H : measurement function
R : measurement noise
I : identity matrix

T : transpose
y : error
K : kalman gain

PREDICTION UPDATE

x' = Fx + u 
- take best estimate x
- multiply it with state transition matrix F
- add whatever motion I know u

covariance matrix P update
P' = F * P * F^T


MEASURMENT UPDATE

y = z - H*x 
- use measurment z
- compare with predition where is measurement function that maps state to measurements
- we call this (y) the error

S = H*P*H^T + R
- error is mapped into a matrix S
- obtained by projecting the system uncertainty P...
- into the measurement space using the measurement function projection
- plus a matrix R that characterizes the measurement noise

K = P * H^t * S^-1
- this is then mapped into a variable called K 
- where we invert the matrix S 

x' = x + (K*y)
- finally actually update our estimate and our uncertainty

P' = (I - K*H) * P
- using cryptic equation
